# Project-Cosmos
This is an old project I started last year.
I am shelving it for now, as I am working on more important projects at the moment.
I may come back to it later, I may not.
This was my first game attempt, I don't think there is really anything of use to professionals since the quality is probably very low.
However, feel free to look through the mess.
